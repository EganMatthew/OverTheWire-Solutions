Natas3
--------------------------

This one gave me a really hard time and I ended up looking up a hint. As it turns out, I'm glad I did because I learned something new from this.

Step 1: <b><br>
The hint I recieved was "robots.txt". I appended this file to the end of the URL and presented with a "Disallowed" path. 

Step 2: <b><br>
From this path, we can access users.txt thus obtaining the password to natas4.


This hint I recieved pretty much solved this problem itself, so I can't really say I solved this one. But what I have learned is that google will index your entire website unless otherwise specified, and this robots.txt is what google checks with. 

The term for what google is doing here is, "web crawling". Google has a particular syntax that it looks for, so if that syntax is wrong, the information that you want to hide may end up being found anyway. Google is not the only web crawler.
