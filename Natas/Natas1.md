Natas-Solutions
==========================

Natas1
--------------------------

This time we can't right click. I actually came across two solutions simultaneously 

(Real)Step 1: <b><br>
From Natas0, I left the view source up. All I did was edit the url, from natas0 to natas1, typed in the password info, and the view source was still in effect

Step 2: <b><br>
Look around and find the password in clear text

(2nd solution, just save the page and view the source via your favorite text editor)
